## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>  
I have been learning `ReactJS` for a while but didn't get a chance to showcase it in a personal project. Hence, I created this project  to learn more about React and Firebase. I am open to work on newer projects if you are interested.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
- They will create tasks and it will show them the tasks that they have under their username as the key
there is no list and tasks inside

only username -> tasks

TO DO:
When user signup, add the email verification section
If email is not verified then make them go to email verification layout

When Signup and email verified complete - create a new list with user's email

When user logs in make all these routes inaccessible: signin, signup and email verification
