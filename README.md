## 🏁 About <a name = "#getting_started"></a>  
I have been learning `ReactJS` for a while but didn't get a chance to showcase it in a personal project. Hence, I created this project  to learn more about React and Firebase. I am open to work on newer projects if you are interested.

Logic: 

The user will login to their to do list application
They will create tasks and it will show them the tasks that they have under their username as the key
there is no list and tasks inside

only username -> tasks




TO DO:
When user signup, add the email verification section
If email is not verified then make them go to email verification layout

When Signup and email verified complete - create a new list with user's email

When user logs in make all these routes inaccessible: signin, signup and email verification
